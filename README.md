### 👋 Hi There!

Allow me to introduce myself. I am a YouTuber called DevDrawer. Check out my tutorials on YouTube and maybe learn something you don't know yet. This profile is a repo for the projects I do there.

I am a software/website developer from the United States and I currently own my own marketing agency. I have a beautiful wife and two kids. I love coding and I love learning new things...so I started a channel to help other people learn some of the things I know as well as keep a video log of new things I learn.

I publish videos weekly, usually related to PHP development using VS Code but sometimes I go outside of my own expertise and teach you something I just learned. Join me and start a conversation.
